If you need information on how to model movement data before feeding into a distribution model, Briana Abrahms put together a one-day [short course](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/briana-abrahms/Movement_Analysis_Workshop/blob/master/Behavioral_Segmentation.html) on animal movement modeling using hidden markov models.
